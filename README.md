# A web view for displaying various React tutorials and projects

## Project Contents:

### Hello World 

Every programmers first foray into coding a new language is this.

### Tic Tac Toe

This started as a tutorial from the reactjs site (https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-for-the-tutorial) then expanded to include the additional improvements.
Once the additional improvements were complete I went on to add Players, High Scores and connect this to an external API (https://github.com/cameronrw-nz/ASPWebAPI).

### MineSweeper

As you guessed it, this is just a basic minesweeper game.

### Product View

This is for learning basic connection of react to an API and manipulating the response for display.
